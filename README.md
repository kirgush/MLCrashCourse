# MLCrashCourse
Julia files inspired by Google's Machine Learning Crash Course

The files in this repository reproduce most of the programming exercises in Google's Machine Learning Crash Course (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) using Tensorflow.jl (https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl). An accompanying blog can be found at https://sdobber.github.io/index.html.

All files have been updated to work on Julia 1.1. At the time of writing (Mar 2019), this requires the developmental versions of the ``PyCall.jl`` and ``Tensorflow.jl``packages.
